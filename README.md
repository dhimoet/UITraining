Repository for training UI candidates

### First time user
Follow these steps below if you are a first time user:
1. Create an account on https://github.com.
2. Download and install SourceTree app from https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/.
3. Run SourceTree and use your github account to set up.
4. On SourceTree, create a new repository by cloning from this URL: https://github.com/dhimoet/UITraining.git
5. Choose your project directory when prompted.
6. Create a new directory and name it with your name.
7. Move your work to that newly created directory.
8. Commit your work by selecting the files on SourceTree, adding a message, and pressing the Commit button.
9. Push your work to GitHub by pressing the Push button.

### How it works
__Adhika__ directory is where you can review the works we have done in our meetings. Do not make any modification under this directory. Create your own directory with your own name and do any works there only. You can commit and push your works anytime you'd like. I will ask you to commit and push your works when I feel the need to check it out, i.e., when you ask me a question regarding your codes.

Please do not be afraid of others checking out your works. We are not getting grades from what we do. Of course any body can copy your codes. But hey, what would they get from copying without even understanding it? Therefore, feel free to share your codes with others.
